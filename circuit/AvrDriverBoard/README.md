# BusDings

This is the driver board which permanently feeds data to the display. It is connected to the master Raspberry Pi via IÂ²C (probably not working due to the lack of pullup resistors) and GPIO pins. The latter is used by the current implementaton. It also has a connector to toggle the backlight relais.
